[id="chapter-missing-in-build_{context}"]
= Chapter does not appear in build

The following error message in an aCoRNs build indicates that the file for a chapter was not generated:

[source,text]
----
Unresolved directive in master-template.adoc - include::acorns/generated/internal/assembly_deprecated-functionality.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
----

aCoRNs generates either an assembly or a reference module for a chapter, depending on the structure:

* If a chapter contains subsections, aCoRNs generates an assembly:
+
`acorns/generated/internal/assembly_deprecated-functionality.adoc`.

* If a chapter contains no subsections, aCoRNs generates a reference module:
+
`acorns/generated/internal/ref_deprecated-functionality.adoc`.

If you change a section from _no subsections_ to _subsections_ or vice versa, you must manually update the `master-template.adoc` file so that the included file is correct.

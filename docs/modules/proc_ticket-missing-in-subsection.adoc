[id="ticket-missing-in-subsection_{context}"]
= Ticket does not appear in subsection

If you created subsections in the `templates.yaml` file and a ticket does not appear in the builds, the most common reason is that the ticket does not match the filter.
For example, the *Component* field of the ticket might not match the component filter of the subsection.

. Check the ticket to ensure that the value of the *Component* field is correct, for example, `FIPS`.
. In your repository, check the filter of the subsection in the `acorns/templates.yaml` file:
+
[source,text]
----
  - &security
    title: "Security and authentication"
    filter
      component: ['Security','SCAP Plugin']
----

. Add the ticket component to the subsection filter:
+
[source,text]
----
      component: ['Security','SCAP Plugin','FIPS']
----
+
Alternatively, add a component override to the ticket in the `acorns/tickets.yaml` file:
+
[source,text]
----
  - [Jira, key: PROJECT-12345, { overrides: {components: ['Security']} }]
